        <!--Paragraph 1 to introduce the ingredients-->
        <p class="paragraph-font">Chicken Marsala is a dish of <span>fried chicken cutlets</span> in a rich
            <span>marsala wine
                sauce</span>. I like the dish because it is delicious and simple to make. The dish is Italian-American made from chicken cutlets, mushrooms, minced garlic or shallots, and Marsala wine, and although traditional Italian versions
            of this dish are typically never served with pasta, some American based restaurants which serve Italian-American cuisine, such as Romano's Macaroni Grill, do serve this dish with pasta (capellini) and whole roasted garlic.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph-font">It is a variation of traditional Italian scaloppina dishes, of which there are many varieties throughout Italy. The dish dates to the 19th century, when it most likely originated with English families who lived in western Sicily, where Marsala
            wine is produced.[2] The chicken is coated in flour, briefly sautéed, and then removed from the pan, which is then used to make a Marsala reduction sauce. The sauce is made by reducing the wine to nearly the consistency of a syrup while adding
            garlic, onions or shallots, as well as mushrooms, herbs and possibly other ingredients. The sauce is then poured over the chicken, which has been kept in a warming oven, and served immediately.</p>

        <p class="paragraph-font">Pounding the chicken breasts into paillards, thin pieces of meat, helps them cook quickly and evenly. And there’s more surface to absorb the burnished Marsala glaze. Putting them in a plastic bag helps makes clean up easier. Once you season the
            breasts, a quick dredging in flour is all that’s needed before frying them up in a big skillet. The finished dish has mushrooms, a bit of stock, and a good pour of Marsala. The final flourish is a sprinkling of chopped parsley. (Which I use
            a lot of, so perhaps “parsley” will be the color of the year next season. See other recipes from the following sites</p>
